/// Performs a Flutter widget test that compares against golden image.

/// This function will perform the required setup and tear down for golden
/// tests. On all platforms, the golden test images will have their text
/// converted to black boxes in order to ensure compatibility between all
/// platforms. However, when running golden tests on macOS, a second set of
/// test images will be generated and compared that contain the raw text as-is.
/// This is because macOS renders text differently than other platforms, which
/// results in inconsistencies in generated golden files between macOS and other
/// platforms.
///
/// Golden tests are run alongside other tests, and can be run using
/// `flutter test`. To update the golden files, after changing the look of a
/// particular widget for example, use `flutter test --update-goldens`.
///
/// The [fileName] is the name of the file that will be used to store the
/// golden image under the `goldens` directory. This name should be unique, and
/// may not contain an extension (such as `.png`).
/// 
/// The [coreWrapper] is [CoreWidgetWrapper] function, which wraps 
/// the base of the golden test. If not null, it replaces default 
/// MaterialApp wrapper. If null, the default MaterialApp wrapper will be used.
///
/// The provided [builder] builds the widget under test.
/// Usually, it creates multiple scenarios using [GoldenTestGroup]
/// and [GoldenTestScenario].
///
/// The [description] must be a unique description for the test.
///
/// The [skip] argument is used to determine if the test should be skipped.
///
/// A list of [tags] can be provided to help identify the test and
/// programmatically filter it when running `flutter test`. By default, a single
/// `'golden'` tag is added to the test (meaning these tests can be excluded by
/// running `flutter test --exclude-tags golden`, or
/// `flutter test --tags golden` to *only* run golden tests).
///
/// The [textScaleFactor], if provided, sets the text scale size (usually in
/// a range from 1 to 3).
///
/// The [constraints] tell the builder how large the total surface of the
/// widget should be. Commonly set to
/// `BoxConstraints.loose(Size(maxWidth, maxHeight))` to limit the maximum
/// size of the widget, while allowing it to be smaller if the content allows
/// for it.
///
/// By default, no constraints are passed, but this can be
/// adjusted to allow for more precise rendering of golden files. If the
/// max width is unbounded, a default width value will be used as initial
/// surface size. The same applies to the max height.
///
/// The [pumpBeforeTest] function will be called with the [WidgetTester] to
/// prime the widget tree before golden evaluation. By default, it is set to
/// [onlyPumpAndSettle], which will pump the widget tree and wait for all
/// scheduled frames to be completed, but can be overridden to customize the
/// pump behavior.
/// See [pumpOnce], [pumpNTimes], [onlyPumpAndSettle], and [precacheImages] for
/// more details.
///
/// The [whilePerforming] interaction, if provided, will be called with the
/// [WidgetTester] to perform a desired interaction during the golden test.
/// Built-in actions, such as [press] and [longPress] are available, which
/// press and long press the appropriate buttons, respectively. Each
/// built-in interaction receives a finder indicating all of the widgets
/// that should be interacted with.
///
/// **Note**: If a built-in [whilePerforming] interaction is provided, the
/// widget tree is **always** pumped at least once before the assertion phase
/// of the test.
///
/// **Note:** If any matched widget does not respond to a press or long
/// press interaction, all other gestures will fail, rendering the
/// [whilePerforming] argument useless.
