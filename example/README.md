# Alchemist Example Project

> For a quick explanation on how to get started with Alchemist, read the [example.md][example_markdown] file or the [Recommended Setup Guide][setup_guide].

This is an example app that showcases the Alchemist golden testing package.

It contains two custom widgets that each have their own golden tests; a [RedButton](./lib/widgets/red_button.dart) and a [ContactListTile](./lib/widgets/contact_list_tile.dart). Both have several variations, all of which are showcased in the app.

The primary goal of this app is to show how to use the Alchemist golden testing package to test widgets. Please see Alchemist's [README](../README.md) for more information, and visit the [`test/`](./test/) directory in this app to see how these widgets are tested.
